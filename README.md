# DungeonRun
This is a Text-based game that allows the user to move through different rooms to get items and accomplish goals.

The program keeps track of user position, has an item inventory, the game has a time limit, and has a fun dungeon theme!

This was the final project for CS-162 (Intro to Computer Programming 2) 

## How to Run the Program?
